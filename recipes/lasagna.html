    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade Lasagna is a family favorite and a great way to feed a crowd.</p>
    <p>In this classic lasagna recipe, sheets of pasta are layered with a cheesy filling, a rich meaty tomato sauce, and more cheese and then baked until bubbly and browned.</p>
    <p>While there are a few steps, this lasagna recipe is relatively easy to make and has so much flavor.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Cheese Filling: For this classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and parmesan with seasonings. You can make homemade ricotta cheese or replace it with cottage cheese.</li>
      <li>Meat: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor, or make my homemade Italian sausage.</li>
      <li>Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer). If using store-bought sauce, I love Rao’s for flavor.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil pasta: In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles per the recipe below.</li>
      <li>Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce (I love this brand) & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
      <li>Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
      <li>Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until the top of the lasagna is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
